Supervised Machine learning: 
In supervised Machine Learning we are learning to create models that combine inputs, to produce useful predictions even on previusly unseen data.
ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data.
### Framing
#### Label is the true thing we're predicting: y
The y variable in basic linear regression

#### Features are input variables describing our data: xi
The {x1, x2, ... xn} variables in basic linear regression

#### Unlabeled example has {features, ?}: (x, ?)
Used for making predictions on new data
