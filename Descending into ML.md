Model is something that learns from data.
Let's take an example in here. Here we have a data with inputs alon x axis and the outputs denoted as the blueish dots.<br>

Now let's draw a line through the most probable regions in the graph. A straight line ofcourse.<br>

Now, this is a stamdard slope equation y = mx + c. In this case we have w i.e weights. <br>

Here we can obviously see that there is loss. The red vertical lines from the main blue line is loss. it maybe positive or negative.<br>
