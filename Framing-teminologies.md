<code>  unlabeled examples: {features, ?}: (x, ?)</code>

### Models
Models means the connection between a label and a feature. 

#### Training a model
Training a model means to create a model. You help it learn by showing examples about the realtionships between lable and feature

#### Inference
Inference means to use the trained model for unlableled examples for predicting useful predictions.

### Regression and Classification Model
A regression model predicts continuous values. 
Eg: What is the value of a house in California? What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?

A classification model predicts discrete values. For example, classification models make predictions that answer questions like the following:
Eg: Is a given email message spam or not spam? Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?
